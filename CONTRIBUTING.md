## Code Style

- Follow the existing TypeScript conventions:  
  - Use ESLint and Prettier (run `pnpm run lint`).  
  - Keep code modular, with small, focused functions.  
  - Document public APIs and React components as needed.

- VS Code extension best practices:  
  - Use the `vscode` namespace for API calls.  
  - Avoid synchronous file I/O on the UI thread when possible.  
  - Keep the Webview UI in `webview-ui/` isolated; treat it like a separate frontend project.
